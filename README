TypogrifyHelper for CakePHP is a conversion of the typogrify module
for Drupal.  It is based off of php-typogrify and PHP SmartyPants.

To use this Helper, just follow these steps:

	To initalize the helper in whatever function you want it to be usable in
	
		function view($id = NULL) {
			$this->helpers[] = 'Typogrify';

			/*
			 * Do some other data processing before passing control off to the view
			 */
		}
	
	To parse text and display the tyopgrified output
	
		<?php echo $typogrify->parse($text) ?>
